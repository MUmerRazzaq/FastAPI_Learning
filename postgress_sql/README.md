# FastAPI & PostgreSQL Learning Journey

I am currently learning **FastAPI** and exploring database handling with **PostgreSQL**. My main goal is to understand how to efficiently manage databases within a modern web application framework.

## Project Overview

To solidify my understanding, I am building a simple **ToDo app**. This project helps me practice:

- **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using PostgreSQL as the backend database.
- Integrating FastAPI with PostgreSQL for seamless data management.
- Implementing **authentication** and **authorization** to manage user access and security.
- Using **SQLAlchemy** to create and manage database schemas in Python code.
- Keeping a record of changes in the database schema over time, learning about schema migrations and version control.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Setting up and connecting FastAPI with a PostgreSQL database.
- Designing and managing database schemas for application data using SQLAlchemy.
- Writing API endpoints to interact with the database.
- Handling user registration, login, and secure access to resources.
- Understanding and applying authentication and authorization best practices.
- Tracking and documenting changes to the database schema as the project evolves.

This hands-on approach is helping me gain practical experience in building secure, database-driven web applications using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, while also learning how to manage and evolve database schemas effectively.
